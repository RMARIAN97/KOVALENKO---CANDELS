In a small village nestled among Ukraine’s rolling sunflower fields, the Kovalenko family once lived a simple but joyful life. Petro, the father, was a carpenter whose hands crafted furniture that filled homes with warmth. His wife, Olena, tended to their modest garden and taught music to local children, her voice as soft as the breeze. Their 12-year-old daughter, Sofia, dreamed of becoming a painter, her sketches of the golden fields pinned to the walls of their cozy home. Their infant son, Ivan, just six months old, filled the house with giggles, his tiny hands reaching for the wooden toys Petro carved.
When Russia’s invasion swept through Ukraine in 2022, everything changed. Petro, with his quiet strength, felt a duty to protect his homeland. “I’ll be back, my love,” he told Olena, kissing her forehead as he hugged Sofia tightly and cradled Ivan one last time. He joined the fight, leaving behind a family clinging to hope. Olena whispered prayers each night, clutching Petro’s old scarf, while Sofia drew pictures of her father as a hero, hoping to see him again.
Months passed with letters from Petro, each one a lifeline. He wrote of cold nights in the trenches but always ended with, “Tell Sofia and Ivan I love them.” Then, in the bitter winter of 2023, the letters stopped. Olena’s heart sank when a fellow soldier arrived at their door, his face heavy with grief. Petro had been killed in a missile strike, saving his squad by drawing fire to himself. “He was brave until the end,” the soldier said, handing Olena Petro’s dog tags, scratched and worn.
Olena was left alone, a widow at 34, with a toddler and a preteen in a war-torn village. Their home, once vibrant, was now a shadow of itself, damaged by nearby shelling. Food was scarce, and Olena worked tirelessly, sewing clothes for neighbors to afford milk for Ivan, who cried for his father’s voice he’d never know. Sofia, once bright and talkative, grew quiet, her sketchbook now filled with somber grays instead of sunny yellows. She helped care for Ivan, rocking him to sleep while Olena worked late, her small hands trembling under the weight of responsibility.
Money dwindled, and the family faced eviction from their rented home. Olena sold Petro’s tools, each hammer and chisel a painful reminder of his absence, but it wasn’t enough. She skipped meals to ensure Sofia and Ivan ate, her own strength fading. “Mama, why don’t you eat?” Sofia asked one night, her eyes wide with worry. Olena forced a smile, saying, “I’m fine, my heart. You and Ivan need it more.” The truth was, she lay awake at night, haunted by the fear of failing her children.
One freezing evening, as snow blanketed their village, Ivan fell ill with a fever. The local clinic, low on supplies due to the war, could only offer basic medicine. Olena walked miles through the cold to find a doctor, carrying Ivan in her arms while Sofia trailed behind, clutching her mother’s coat. “We can’t lose him too,” Sofia whispered, tears freezing on her cheeks. Olena fought back her own tears, promising, “We won’t, my love. We’ll keep going.”
Starting from nothing, Olena began selling handmade candles, pouring her heart into each one, using wax from old supplies Petro had stored. She worked by lamplight, her fingers raw, to keep her family afloat. Sofia helped package them, drawing small sunflower designs on the labels, a tribute to their father’s love for Ukraine’s fields. Each sale was a lifeline, but the family still struggled to afford rent and Ivan’s medicine. Olena’s dream was to save enough to move to a safer town, where Sofia could go to school again and Ivan could grow up without the echo of war.
Their story is one of loss and resilience, a mother fighting to keep her children safe in a world torn apart. Every purchase from their small candle business is more than a transaction—it’s a chance for Olena, Sofia, and Ivan to survive, to hold onto hope, and to honor Petro’s sacrifice. Supporting them means giving a family, broken but unyielding, a chance to rebuild from the ashes of war.
